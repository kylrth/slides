## What is Linux?

Technically, .highlight1[Linux] is an operating system *kernel*.
A kernel provides basic abstraction and functionality on top of the hardware.
It controls running processes, manages memory, and provides simplified access to storage.

.center[![:scale 30%](kernel.jpg)]

The .highlight1[GNU Project] provides many utility programs to be used in an operating system.
These are packaged together with the Linux kernel to create a functional system, called .highlight1[GNU/Linux].

---

## What is Linux?

A Linux .highlight1[distribution] (distro) is a package containing the Linux kernel, core utilities (usually GNU), and other pre-packaged programs.
At a minimum this includes:

- a .highlight1[package manager] (`deb`, `apt`, `pacman`, etc.) to easily install and upgrade programs
- for desktops, a .highlight1[desktop environment] (GNOME, KDE Plasma, Xfce, etc.) to provide a GUI

Popular distros include Ubuntu, Debian, Manjaro, Mint, Fedora, openSUSE, elementaryOS, and [the list goes on](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity).

--

<br /><br /><br />
.references[Installing Linux is not necessary for this class.
If you want to install Linux, there are plenty of resources online.
Pick a distro and go for it!]

---

## Why do I care about Linux?

- Most computing clusters run Linux distributions.
--

- Linux provides access to powerful low-level tools.
--

- Now even Windows provides a Linux subsystem (WSL), and the terminal environment in OSX is extremely similar.
--

- Most of all, Linux is .highlight1[free] and open-source.
--

## shells 🐚

A .highlight1[shell] is a textual interface that allows you to run programs at a low level.
It allows you to take full advantage of all the tools in a computer.

The shell can be accessed through a .highlight1[terminal], which is installed by default in nearly all operating systems.
The terminal is a fundamental tool in Linux systems.

--

When we launch the terminal we see a shell .highlight1[prompt] that looks something like this:

```sh
kyle:~$
```

or

```sh
[kyle@computer ~]$
```

You can modify the prompt as you like! .cite[[(instructions)](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/35777/how-to-change-the-prompt-in-linux)]

---

## shells 🐚

A shell provides a .highlight1[read-eval-print loop] (REPL).
You enter a command, the shell runs it, the output is printed, and the shell prompts you for another command.

```sh
kyle:~$ echo Hello world!
Hello world!
kyle:~$
```

---

## shells 🐚

A shell provides a .highlight1[read-eval-print loop] (REPL).
You enter a command, the shell runs it, the output is printed, and the shell prompts you for another command.

```sh
kyle:~$ echo Hello world!
Hello world!
kyle:~$ mkdir data
kyle:~$
```

---

## shells 🐚

A shell provides a .highlight1[read-eval-print loop] (REPL).

## `bash` is probably your shell

Bash is by far the most common shell.
If you log into a Linux machine, chances are you're using `bash`.

```sh
kyle:~$ echo $0
bash
```

Other options include `zsh`, `dash`, `fish`, `ksh`, `ash`, and the original `sh`.

The behavior of `sh` is the basis for the .highlight1[POSIX standard].
Other shells add convenient features, but are generally .highlight1[POSIX-compliant] as well.

---

## super user

There can be multiple users on a single Linux machine:

```sh
kyle:~$ users
kyle mckay stephen
```

--

But there's always another user, `root`, which is called the .highlight1[super user].
The super user has administrative privileges.
It can:

.left-column[
- install programs system-wide
- view/modify any user's data
]
.right-column[
- pretend to be any other user
- and many other things
]

---

## super user

.bigger[Avoid using `root` unless you need to!]

```sh
kyle:~$ pacman -S inkscape
error: you cannot perform this operation unless you are root.
kyle:~$ sudo su
Password:
root:/home/kyle# pacman -S inkscape
...
root:/home/kyle# exit
kyle:~$
```

--

Here's a shortcut:

```sh
kyle:~$ sudo pacman -S inkscape
[sudo] password for kyle:
...
kyle:~$
```

.context[`sudo` stands for "Super User DO".]

---

- `man`: manual (also: `info`)
- `pwd`: print working dir
- `ls`: list files
- `cd`: change working directory
- `mkdir`: make directory
- `rmdir`: remove directory

## `tmux`: terminal multiplexer

.context[Not a must-learn, but highly recommended]

`tmux` is probably the most popular multiplexer and it offers two main useful features:

- split the terminal window into multiple terminal instances
- handle sessions that can be attached or detached without stopping the programs

Furthermore, `tmux` is highly customizable to fit your needs.

However:

- The default control keys are pretty weird.
- It may take some time to get used to it.

]

---

## command-line editors

It is worth learning at least one command-line text editor:

- to edit files without leaving the terminal, even if only occasionally
- to edit files on a remote machine

`vim` and `emacs` are the most popular editors.

We'll use `vim` today, but you can use whatever you like (even `nano`).
Let's not get into an [editor war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war). 🙂

---

## SSH

The .highlight1[secure shell protocol] (SSH) provides a way to log in to remote computers securely over an insecure channel.

You generally run SSH from your terminal on your computer:

```sh
kyle:~$ ls
Documents Downloads Movies programming
kyle:~$ ssh george@example.com
Password:
george@example.com:~$ ls
bin mkp224o research services snap
george@example.com:~$ logout
Connection to 93.184.216.34 closed.
kyle:~$
```

.references[SSH uses [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) to secure the communication.]

---

## SSH config

You can store profiles for each computer you access in a file at `~/.ssh/config`.
Here's an example:

```ssh-config
Host ift6759
    Hostname ift6759.calculquebec.cloud
    User kylrth
```

Then accessing the Calcul Québec resources is as easy as running `ssh ift6759`.

.references[See [`man ssh_config`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/ssh_config.5.html) for more details.]

---

## SSH keys

When using SSH, it's best to use an SSH key, rather than entering your password every time.
To generate a public key, run:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

(By default, `ssh-keygen` generates an RSA key, but ED25519 is *theoretically* [more secure](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/90077/ssh-key-ed25519-vs-rsa).)

Running the above creates `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`.
Copy `id_ed25519.pub` to the remote server as a new line in the file `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.
(For Calcul Québec, visit the [user portal](https://mokey.ift6759.calculquebec.cloud/sshpubkey) to upload your key.)

From now on, you won't need to enter a password!

## Python virtual environments

.highlight1[Virtual environments] encapsulate a Python version and a set of packages.
This is useful for several reasons:

- for better .highlight1[reproducibility]: to be clear about which packages you use for a project
- to use a particular version of a package without affecting the version you use for other projects
- to prevent conflicts of package versions across projects

--

`virtualenv` is a tool to create Python environments. This is the basic usage:

```sh
$ virtualenv ./env
$ source ./env/bin/activate
$ pip install numpy pandas sklearn
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
$ deactivate
```

.references[
- You may also use [`conda`](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python)
- There exist `virtualenv` wrappers: [`virtualenvwrapper`](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenvwrapper/), [`pipenv`](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/), [`poetry`](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/)...
- [`virtualenv` docs](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/index.html), with description, user guides, etc.
]

---

## Python linting

Linters are tools that analyse code to flag errors and ensure compliance to standards.
Some reasons to use linters are:

- They can catch simple mistakes.
- They can enforce code cleanliness, which makes it more readable.
- They can save time by automatically formatting things for us, instead of leaving us to do it by hand.

--

Some popular linters for Python:

* [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html) checks compliance with PEP8, unused imports, etc.
* [`isort`](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) sorts imports.
* [`black`](https://pypi.org/project/black/) formats code according to a particular style.

--

To get them all:

``` bash
$ pip install flake8 isort black
```

---

## Let's try it!

Starting from the example repo here: https://github.com/kylrth/ift-6759-extremeweather

- fork the repo to your own account
- (recommended: SSH to Calcul Québec to do the following)
- clone your repository
- set up a virtualenv with the necessary packages
- use `pip freeze` to create `requirements.txt`
- commit that file
- use `flake8`, `isort`, and `black` to fix linting errors in `train.py`
- commit those changes
- push to your GitHub repository
- open a pull request to add those changes back to .highlight1[my] repository

## Python CLI debugging

Debugging Python in the command-line is enabled by [`pdb`, The Python Debugger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html). [`ipdb`](https://pypi.org/project/ipdb/) enables access to [`IPython`](http://ipython.org/) while debugging.

--

To insert a breakpoint:

``` python
breakpoint()  # or import pdb; pdb.set_trace() if Python <3.7
```

Basic commands:

.left-column[
* `l`(ist) 11 lines around the breakpoint
* `w`(here): show file and line number
* `n`(ext): execute current line
* `s`(tep): into function
]
.right-column[
* `r`(eturn): execute until return
* `c`(ontinue) until breakpoint
* `b #`: add a breakpoint at line #
* `cl`(ear) breakpoints
* `q`(uit)
]
